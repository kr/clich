This is a parser for the Lich[1] data format, written in C.
It's not much code (about 160 lines), and intended to be
copied into your project. You need two files:

	lich.h
	lich.c

The interface for this code is small. It's designed in the
same vein as https://github.com/kr/json. In other words,
this parser doesn't do very much; it really only parses.
Doesn't do any converting or creating of higher-level data
structures for you.
